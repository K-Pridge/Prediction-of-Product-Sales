# Prediction-of-Product-Sales
This project visualizes correlations to numerical and categorical types of data from specific categories that feel necessary for stakeholders to make future decisions. 
The catplot for Outlet_Type gives an excellent representation of which specific outlets are performing at a higher rate. This shows that Supermarkets are the highest producing. 
Both heatmaps show a weak negative correlation to most categories. Although the values of (-) tend to show the most, there are positive strong correlations with a score of 1 to the following: Item_Outlet_Sales, Outlet_Establishment_Year, Item_MRP, Item_Visibility and Item_Weight.
